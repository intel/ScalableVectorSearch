    Save the optimization flags to a text file suitable for CMake to injest easily.

    Each entry in `flags` will be interpreted as a set of compiler flags for some
    microarchitecture. By default, archspec passes this as a space-delimited string.
    Because CMake has this tendency to treat both spaces and semi-colons as array
    separators, we introduce a comma between each flag set to assist in post-procfessing
    on the CMake side.

    We generate one such super-string per entry in `flags` and store the file at the
    file pointed to by `path`.
