/**
 * @file avx2.cpp
 * @brief AVX2 specific SIMD operation instantiations
 *
 * This compilation unit is built with `-march=haswell` compiler flags to enable
 * AVX2 instruction generation. It contains explicit instantiations of SIMD operation
 * structs to force the compiler to generate optimized code using AVX2 intrinsics.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We instantiate SIMD ops (IPFloatOp, L2FloatOp, CosineFloatOp), NOT
 * distance implementations (*Impl). This eliminates the need to instantiate for all
 * combinations of dimensionality N, which would create 9Ã— more instantiations.
 *
 * The SIMD ops contain all AVX-specific code and are defined in the distance headers
 * within #if !SVS_AVX512_F && SVS_AVX2 guards. By instantiating them here with proper
 * compiler flags, we ensure optimized machine code is generated and linked into the library.
